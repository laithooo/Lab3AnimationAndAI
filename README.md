# Lab3AnimationAndAI

This assignment helped me explore how to use the animator alongside the navmesh/navmeshagent feature, which could help me out in situations in my GDW group project where we have to create hordes of enemies to chase after the player and kill them. It'll help us save so much valuable time instead of coding and manually adding a path for every enemy
